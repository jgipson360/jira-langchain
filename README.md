# Jira LangChain Automation Tool

Automated Jira ticket creation using LangChain and Jira Toolkit. Generates epics, stories, and tasks from text input based on configurable Jira connection settings.

## Fun Fact üè†

This project was born out of a very real need! I was facing a massive family home cleanup project involving deep cleaning, and organization across multiple rooms. With hundreds of interconnected tasks, dependencies, and different family members involved, I needed a way to quickly organize everything in Jira without spending hours clicking through the interface. What started as "I need to create 50+ tickets for a home cleanup project" became a robust automation tool that handles complex project structures, smart epic mapping, and dependency relationships. Sometimes the best software comes from solving your own immediate problems! üêõ‚û°Ô∏è‚úÖ

## Features

# Create tickets with LLM enhancement
python main.py -i tickets.txt --enhance

# Verbose output
python main.py -i tickets.txt --verbose
```

## Input Format

The tool supports multiple input formats and automatically detects the best parsing approach:

### üìã Structured Format
For maximum control, use the structured format:

```
epic:

Epic 1: [Epic Title]
Epic Name: [Epic Name for Jira]
Description: [Detailed description of the epic]
Business Outcome: [Expected business outcome]
Priority: [Highest/High/Medium/Low/Lowest]

Epic 1: [Epic Title] - User Stories
Story 1: [Story Title]
Story Key: [PROJECT-KEY]-1
Priority: [Priority Level]
Parent: [EPIC-PREFIX]
Dependencies: [EPIC-PREFIX - Task Name], [Another Epic - Task Name]
Estimated Effort: [8 hours]
Labels: [backend, api, critical]
As a [user type] I want [functionality] So that [benefit]
Acceptance Criteria:
* [Criterion 1]
* [Criterion 2]
* [Criterion 3]

Story 2: [Another Story Title]
Story Key: [PROJECT-KEY]-2
Priority: [Priority Level]
As a [user type] I want [functionality] So that [benefit]
Acceptance Criteria:
* [Criterion 1]
* [Criterion 2]
```

### üß† Natural Language Format
The tool also handles natural language descriptions thanks to LLM fallback:

```
We need to clean up the kitchen and organize everything.

First, we should deal with the organization issue in the pantry.
This involves removing all items, cleaning the area, and then restocking.

Then we need to deep clean all surfaces including:
- Countertops and backsplash
- Inside of all cabinets
- Appliance exteriors and interiors
- Floor mopping and baseboards

Finally, we should organize everything by category and label containers.
```

**The system will automatically:**
- üéØ Detect epic relationships and create missing parent epics
- üîó Parse and resolve dependencies between tasks
- üè∑Ô∏è Extract and clean labels from text
- üìä Link stories to appropriate epics using existing project structure
- ü§ñ Fall back to LLM parsing when structured parsing is incomplete

## Configuration

### Jira Setup

1. **Generate API Token**:
   - Go to [Atlassian Account Settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
   - Create API token
   - Copy the token to your `.env` file

2. **Find Project Key**:
   - Go to your Jira project
   - Look at the URL or project settings
   - Use the short key (e.g., "PROJ" for project "PROJ-123")

### LLM Setup

**For Claude (Anthropic)**:
```bash
LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

**For Gemini (Google)**:
```bash
LLM_PROVIDER=google
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Parse and preview tickets (always test first!)
python main.py -i tickets.txt --dry-run

# Create tickets with automatic epic discovery
python main.py -i tickets.txt

# Create with AI enhancement and verbose output
python main.py -i tickets.txt --enhance --verbose
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Use custom config file
python main.py -i tickets.txt -c production.env

# Process multiple files with batch operations
for file in tickets/*.txt; do
    python main.py -i "$file" --enhance
done

# Test complex natural language processing
python main.py -i messy_notes.txt --dry-run --verbose
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Missing required Jira configuration"**
   - Check your `.env` file exists and has all required fields
   - Verify API token is correct

2. **"Failed to connect to Jira"**
   - Verify Jira URL is correct (include https://)
   - Check API token permissions
   - Ensure project key exists and you have access

3. **"Import errors"**
   - Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. **"LLM API errors"**
   - Verify API key is correct
   - Check API quota/limits
   - Ensure LLM_PROVIDER matches your API key type

5. **"ChatAnthropic validation errors"**
   - Ensure both model name and API key are provided
   - Test connection with: `python -c "from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic; import os; llm = ChatAnthropic(model='claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', anthropic_api_key=os.getenv('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')); print('‚úÖ Connection successful')"`

6. **"Epic mapping issues"**
   - The system automatically discovers epics - no manual configuration needed
   - Check that existing epics follow naming conventions (e.g., "PREP - Kitchen Cleanup")
   - Use `--verbose` to see epic discovery process

7. **"Dependency resolution problems"**
   - Dependencies are automatically resolved using epic prefixes and task names
   - Use format: `[EPIC-PREFIX - Task Name]` for best results
   - Check `--dry-run` output to verify dependency links

8. **"LLM fallback not working"**
   - Ensure LLM_PROVIDER is set correctly (anthropic/google)
   - Check API key permissions and quotas
   - LLM fallback activates when structured parsing finds few/incomplete issues

### Advanced Features Troubleshooting

**Dynamic Epic Discovery**
```bash
# Test epic discovery independently
python main.py -i empty_file.txt --dry-run --verbose
# Look for "üîç Discovered X epics" messages
```

**Dependency Linking**
```bash
# Verify dependency format in input
# Use: Dependencies: [KITCH - Clean counters], [PREP - Remove items]
python main.py -i tickets.txt --dry-run --verbose
# Check for "üîó Resolved dependency" messages
```

**LLM Fallback Activation**
```bash
# Test with natural language input
python main.py -i natural_language.txt --dry-run --verbose
# Look for "ü§ñ Structured parsing incomplete - trying LLM fallback"
```

### Debug Mode

Run with verbose output to see detailed information:
```bash
python main.py -i tickets.txt --verbose --dry-run
```

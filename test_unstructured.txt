We need to implement several features for our project:

First, we need to create a user authentication system. This should allow users to log in and log out securely. The system should support password reset functionality and two-factor authentication.

Second, we need to build a dashboard that shows key metrics. Users should be able to see their activity, progress, and important notifications. The dashboard should be responsive and work on mobile devices.

Third, we need to implement a reporting system. Users should be able to generate reports, export them as PDF or CSV, and schedule automated reports to be sent via email.

Finally, we need to add a notification system that can send alerts via email, SMS, or push notifications depending on user preferences.

All of these features should be completed by the end of the month and should include proper testing and documentation.
